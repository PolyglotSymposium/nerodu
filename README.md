Not having had a good success in actually completing any languages, I am now
taking a rigidly, laughably slow approach to implementing a language: taking
off such small bites that I intend to implement a full "language" at every
iteration, as recorded below.

# Lang 0: AnythingGoesLang

Has a REPL. You type something in, out it comes. ^C quits. Implemented in seven
lines of code.

# Lang 1: LonelyAlone

Not exactly Turing Complete, but shall we say "Void complete". Technically no
true language present. You can use a REPL command to query the type of Void,
and the type of Type; and to declare identifiers to be of type Type,
implemented by Void. That is all.
