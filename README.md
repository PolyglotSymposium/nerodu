Not having had a good success in actually completing any languages, I am now
taking a rigidly, laughably slow approach to implementing a language: taking
off such small bites that I intend to implement a full "language" at every
iteration, as recorded below.

# Lang 0: AnythingGoesLang

Has a REPL. You type something in, out it comes. ^C quits. Implemented in seven
lines of code.

# Lang 1: LonelyAloneLang

Not exactly Turing Complete, but shall we say "Void complete". Technically no
true language present. You can use a REPL command to query the type of Void,
and the type of Type; and as it has the exotic feature of dependent types, to
declare alphanumeric identifiers to be of type Type, implemented by Void. That
is all.
